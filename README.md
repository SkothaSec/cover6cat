# cover6cat

A minimal Vite + React dev shell for the cover6cat static site.

## Getting started

```bash
yarn install
yarn dev
```

`yarn dev` starts Vite with hot module replacement on http://localhost:5173/ and opens your browser automatically (configured in `vite.config.js`).

Build a production bundle with:

```bash
yarn build
```

Preview the production build locally with:

```bash
yarn preview
```
